## Vue 3 + Vite

### About this app
This is a  Test application I build to re-familiarize myself with Vue,  Vite and introduce myself to  Co-Pilot . It has been a few years since i built a web application and wanted to see what has changed and how the use of AI can assist with building an application.


### approach  to  project
The site is a simple quote a day application. Special thanks to Logan Rhoades for curating the Mitch Hedberg jokes that  I used to start this at, found on the Buzzfeed page:
https://www.buzzfeed.com/mrloganrhoades/a-complete-ranking-of-almost-every-single-mitch-hedberg-joke
I used this for the base of quotes in a json file. Once working I added  Dad jokes and Frank quotes in google's top XX list and layer in the json file for name and a quote object with array of text strings.
